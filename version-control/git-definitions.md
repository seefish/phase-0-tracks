# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.


* What is version control? Why is it useful?
  * Version control allows us to view the entire history of revision to one or more files, and merge the revisions made by different people. It is usefule because it enables us to see previous code, view who has made code changes; and revert to previous versions if a mistke is made.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  * A branch is a self-contained copy of the project source code that can be used to allow a team of developers to work on multiple streams of work independently from each other while providing the ability to merge this work back together when their work is finished.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  * When you commit a set of files and folders, you are making a save point for the project. The commit message describes this save point for future reference. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit. Some examples of good commit messages are

* What is a merge conflict?
  * A merge conflict occurs when two branches you are trying to merge make changes to the same part of the same file. In these cases Git won't be able to figure out which version to use.
